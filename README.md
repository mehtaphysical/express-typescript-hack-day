# React with TypeScript

## Background

### Computer Parts

* CPU - Central Processing Unit executes instructions as machine code
* VM - Virtual Machine interprets source code (or bytecode) and executes the instructions

### Interpreted Language

The source code is interpreted and executed line by line at runtime.

### Compiled

> to compose out of materials from other documents

> a computer program that translates an entire set of instructions written in a higher-level
> symbolic language (such as C) into machine language before the instructions can be executed

* static types vs dynamic types
  * check types at compile time
  * check types at runtime
* TypeScript
  * compile to JavaScript language
  * superset of JavaScript (adds typing)
  * type inference
  * static type checking (compare with dynamic)
  * structural type checking (duck typing) (compare with nominal type checking)
* specifying types and inferred types
  * string
  * number
  * boolean
* defining functions param types and return type
  * add function
  * longestString
* type composition
  * add with string or number
* custom types or object shapes (duck typing)
  * Dog (with optional properties)
    * createDog
  * Person
    * oldestPerson
  * HasName
    * findByName
* Generics
  * findByName

## Express
